- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SamuelCox
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in all things Distributed Systems, Event-Driven Architecture, DDD, and Cloud-Native (All the buzzwords basically). 
      I'm also primarily interested in the C# / .NET ecosystem
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently (very slowly) working on my own [application protocol](https://github.com/SamuelCox/RDFP),
      as well as a decentralised chat app.
